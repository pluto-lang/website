# Multi-Platform Deployment

Pluto supports deploying applications to different platforms without modifying the code. Configuration information for different platforms is managed through the concept of Stacks. You can specify which stack to deploy to during the deployment process.

Next, we'll briefly introduce how to use Pluto for multi-platform deployment.

### Creating a New Stack

By executing the following command, you will enter an interactive interface where you can customize the stack's name, target deployment platform, and other configuration information:

```shell
pluto stack new
```

### Deploying to a Specified Stack

When deploying, you can specify which stack to deploy to:

```shell
pluto deploy --stack [STACK_NAME]
```

### Taking Down from a Specified Stack

Executing the following command can take down a Pluto application from a specified stack:

```shell
pluto destroy --stack [STACK_NAME]
```
