# Quick Start

Let's get to know the Pluto app development process by quickly developing a simple Web application. Don't worry if you don't have a Pluto development environment, as we offer a variety of development environments for you to choose from.

The application we are going to develop is called Timestamp Store, with an architecture as shown in the figure below. It mainly has 2 routes: 1) `/hello`, which generates a timestamp and publishes it to the message queue; 2) `/store`, which retrieves the timestamp of the last visit to `/hello` from the KV database and returns it. There will be a subscriber in the message queue that saves the message to the KV database. We can deploy this application on AWS or Kubernetes.

After completing this example, you will understand the basic process of Pluto development and can start using Pluto to develop your own cloud applications.

To make it easier for developers to get started, we provide the following three development methods:

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<AiOutlineCloud size="20" />}
    title="Online Development"
    href="getting-started/online-development"
  />
  <Card
    icon={<TbBrandDocker size="20" />}
    title="Container Development"
    href="getting-started/container-development"
  />
  <Card
    icon={<MdComputer size="20" />}
    title="Local Development"
    href="getting-started/local-development"
  />
</Cards>

Pluto supports deploying applications to different platforms without modifying the code. You can learn how to use this capability from the following document:
