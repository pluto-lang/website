# Website

The `Website` resource represents a static website that can be hosted on cloud services. Such websites typically consist of a set of static files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are updated each time the application is redeployed.

## How to Use

### Creating a Resource

<Tabs items={["Python", "TypeScript"]} storageKey="lang">

<Tab>
```python
from pluto_client import Website

website = Website(path="./website", name="website")
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
```typescript
import { Website } from "@plutolang/pluto";

const website = new Website("./website", "website");
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

Based on the example code above, you can store the static files of the website in the `./website` directory, including all static files such as `index.html`. The `name` parameter in the constructor can be left empty, with the default name of the website being `default`, which is related to the final generated URL.

### Associating Dependent Resources

Static websites might need to access other resources, such as backend services. In such cases, you can use the `addEnv` method to pass information about other resources to the website.

During deployment, Pluto generates a `pluto.js` file in the root directory of the website and exposes these variables in the form of `window.plutoEnv`. Therefore, in the code that follows `<script src="pluto.js"></script>` (Requires manual addition), you can access these environment variables through `window.plutoEnv`.

<Tabs items={["Python", "TypeScript"]} storageKey="lang">

<Tab>
```python
from pluto_client import Function

echo = Function(lambda x: x)
website.addEnv("ECHO_URL", echo.url())
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
```typescript
import { Function } from "@plutolang/pluto";

const echo = new Function(async function echo(x: string) {
  return x;
});
website.addEnv("ECHO_URL", echo.url());
```
</Tab>
