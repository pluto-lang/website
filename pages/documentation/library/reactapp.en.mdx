# ReactApp

`ReactApp` resources are used to host React front-end applications on cloud services.

## How to Use

### Creating a Resource

<Tabs items={["Python", "TypeScript"]} storageKey="lang">
<Tab>
```python
from pluto_client import ReactApp, ReactAppOptions
app = ReactApp(
  project_path="./web", 
  name="web", 
  opts=ReactAppOptions(buildCommand="npm run build", buildDir="build"),
)
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
```typescript
import { ReactApp } from "@plutolang/pluto";
const app = new ReactApp("./web", "web", {
  buildCommand: "npm run build",
  buildDir: "build",
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

As shown in the example code above, the `./web` directory is the root directory of the React front-end application. The `name` parameter in the constructor can be omitted, in which case the default name of the site will be `default`. This name is related to the URL that will be generated eventually. You can also configure the build command, build directory, and so forth through the `options` parameter.

Additionally, it supports deploying to Vercel. You just need to set `platform` to `Vercel` in the third parameter `options` of the constructor, and at the same time, set `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` in the `.env` file or environment variables. If these are not set or set to invalid parameters, it will default to deploying on the cloud provider you have specified.

### Associating Dependent Resources

Front-end applications often need to access other resources to implement the full functionality of the app. This can be achieved by using the `addEnv` method to pass the information of other resources to the website.
During deployment, Pluto will create a `pluto.js` file in the root directory of the site, and expose these variables as `window.plutoEnv` within that file.

Therefore, by adding a line of code `<script src="pluto.js"></script>` to the `<head>` tag of your React app's `index.html`, following scripts can access these variables via `window.plutoEnv`.

from pluto_client import Function

echo = Function(lambda x: x)
app.addEnv("ECHO_URL", echo.url())

import { Function } from "@plutolang/pluto";

const echo = new Function(async function echo(x: string) {
  return x;
});
app.addEnv("ECHO_URL", echo.url());
